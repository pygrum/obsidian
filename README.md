## Overview

Obsidian is a tool designed to test web application endpoints for common vulnerabilities. 
These include Log4Shell, SQLi, path traversal, and more. Obsidian is written in Python, and uses json configuration
files to load targets and payloads. Users are able to specify types of tests to run, as well as which targets to run
them on.
